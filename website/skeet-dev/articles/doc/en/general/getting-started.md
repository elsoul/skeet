## The Complete Web Framework for Modern Developers

With Skeet v3, weâ€™ve fully migrated to Cloudflare, eliminating cold starts and introducing support for edge runtime. It has been transformed into a serverless-native architecture, optimized for the modern web.

ðŸš§ The Skeet development team is currently focused on building v3. Active development is underway.
