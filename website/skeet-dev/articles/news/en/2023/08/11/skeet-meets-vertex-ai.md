ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) announced the version 1.1.0 of the open-source TypeScript full-stack serverless app framework "Skeet."

Skeet is an open-source TypeScript serverless framework that allows you to build full-stack apps on GCP (Google Cloud) and Firebase.

From the API server to web, iOS, and Android apps, you can consistently develop in TypeScript at lightning speed.

With this update, Skeet now not only supports OpenAI's ChatGPT (like GPT-4) but also Google's Vertex AI.

Vertex AI is Google Cloud's fully managed machine learning (ML) tool for any use case that accelerates building, deploying, and scaling ML models.

Vertex AI recently extended support for Google's Large Language Model (LLM), known as PaLM2, encompassing Generative AI capabilities.

PaLM2 efficiently leverages multilingual and diverse pre-training datasets, boasting improved performance even with fewer tokens or smaller models.

A standout feature of PaLM2 is its prompt adjustment and fine-tuning capabilities. The quality of outputs, especially when tailoring the model for specific business needs, surpasses competing products like ChatGPT.

Using Skeet, businesses can swiftly integrate Vertex AI and deploy a bespoke AI application tailored to their unique needs.
