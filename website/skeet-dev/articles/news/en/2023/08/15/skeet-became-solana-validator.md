The Solana blockchain is gaining attention due to its speed and low transaction costs, with many projects selecting this platform. By functioning as a Solana validator, the Skeet team will enhance the safety and efficiency of the blockchain network and participate in the approval of transactions and block generation.

Through this role, the Skeet team's understanding and knowledge of Solana will deepen further. This signifies the provision of an even more innovative and user-friendly framework for Web3 and blockchain development utilizing Solana. Developers of Skeet aim to leverage this knowledge to enrich the framework's features, positioning Skeet as an appealing choice for Web3 app and dApp developers.

Furthermore, as an open-source platform, Skeet's philosophy emphasizes the democratization and sharing of technology. This role as a validator is a significant step to promote the proliferation and sharing of blockchain technology, which is believed to foster growth and advancement for the entire community.

Lastly, the rewards earned as a Solana validator will be used to further develop the Skeet framework and manage the community. This will enable Skeet to solidify its position as a sustainable, continuously growing open-source community. The Skeet team eagerly looks forward to expanding partnerships through this new initiative, aiming to co-create the future of blockchain technology.
