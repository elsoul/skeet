ELSOUL LABO B.V. (based in Amsterdam, Netherlands) has announced the addition of a new UI tailored for Google AI (Product Name: Vertex AI, Model: PaLM2 chat-bison) to their open-source app framework "Skeet."

"Skeet" is an open-source, TypeScript serverless framework that facilitates the construction of full-stack apps on both GCP (Google Cloud) and Firebase.

With "Skeet", you can quickly develop anything from API servers to Web, iOS, and Android apps consistently using TypeScript.

Now, with the addition of the Google AI UI to "Skeet", it's even easier to create customized AI chatbots.

Since "Skeet" is open-source, anyone can use it freely at no cost.

With just a single command, you can set up the Google AI customization environment, develop your own or your business's specialized AI chatbot, and release it instantly.

Using Skeet's new UI, you can easily create AI chatbots specialized for specific domains. By providing input/output pairs, the bot learns to converse according to the unique needs of industries and businesses.

Initially, it couldn't identify "Epics" and would generate arbitrary responses.

By adding input and output pairs, the AI learns the dialogue and starts generating responses more aligned with the intended purpose.

With Skeet, you can quickly set up a development environment for apps utilizing Google AI (Product Name: Vertex AI, Model: PaLM2 chat-bison) or OpenAI's ChatGPT (Model: GPT-4 and similar). You can kick-start development from a functioning app, release it immediately, and proceed with validating the service's Product-Market Fit (PMF).

"Skeet" is developed as an open-source tool aiming to reduce the development and maintenance costs in app development scenarios worldwide and to enhance the developer experience. Everyone is free to use it, so give it a try!
