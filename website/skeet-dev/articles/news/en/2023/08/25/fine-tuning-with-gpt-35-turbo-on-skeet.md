ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) has announced the release of version 1.4.0 of "Skeet AI," a plugin for the open-source "Skeet," allowing easy customization of generative AIs such as ChatGPT and Vertex AI for in-house use.

Skeet is an open-source, TypeScript-based serverless framework that can build full-stack apps on GCP (Google Cloud) and Firebase.

From API servers to Web, iOS, and Android apps, everything can be rapidly developed using TypeScript.

With this update, Skeet now allows easy execution of GPT-3.5's Fine-tuning using TypeScript.

## Fine-tuning with ChatGPT's GPT-3.5 Turbo

The benefits of fine-tuning are as follows:

- Generation of high-quality responses
- Application of more examples
- Cost savings (reduction in token count and processing time)

In initial tests, the fine-tuned "GPT-3.5 Turbo" has been reported to demonstrate performance equal to or greater than "GPT-4" in specific narrow tasks.

With Skeet, fine-tuning with GPT-3.5 Turbo can be easily executed, and the resulting model is ready to be integrated into applications.

Tools are also provided to create datasets for fine-tuning (in JSONL format) from various data formats (such as Markdown documents), allowing for consistent and rapid customization of AI models and application development leveraging them.

We will continue to enhance a wide range of development support for utilizing AI, building a faster and more convenient development environment.

Skeet is developed as open-source to reduce development and maintenance costs for application developers worldwide and enhance the developer experience.
