ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) has announced the release of Skeet AI v1.5, which enhances AI support for app development on its open-source solution "Skeet" that enables rapid development and deployment of ChatGPT-powered apps.

Skeet is an open-source, TypeScript-based, serverless framework that allows for full-stack app development on Google Cloud (GCP) and Firebase.

With Skeet, you can rapidly develop everything from API servers to Web, iOS, and Android apps all in TypeScript. The framework proactively adopts technologies that offer a positive developer experience, such as GraphQL and Firestore. It also facilitates the easy development of modern applications that utilize AI technologies like ChatGPT and Vertex AI, as well as blockchain technologies like Solana for Web3 dApp development.

With this update, specialized AI models (ChatGPT and Vertex AI) for Skeet development support can now be easily accessed through Skeet CLI. Skeet aims to further boost developer productivity through enhanced AI support for Skeet app development.

## Development Support with Skeet AI

Application frameworks can improve developer productivity by auto-generating the foundational code for app development. Many frameworks come with development tools that automate various development tasks.

However, mastering these tools often requires a learning curve. Even after learning, itâ€™s easy to forget how to use them due to various reasons, necessitating a relearning process.

Skeet AI addresses this challenge. The image below illustrates one example of the AI console provided by Skeet AI.

Here, simply by expressing a desire to enable user tweeting, Skeet AI automatically proposes the necessary data model. Developers can either adopt the proposed data model as is or refine it based on more specific requirements. Once the data model is decided, Skeet AI will either auto-generate the necessary code or ask the developer for further input.

Developers can now have code auto-generated by simply consulting with the AI about the app they wish to create.

Such enriched AI development support minimizes the framework's learning cost and enhances developer productivity.

Currently available AI support includes:

- AI for Firestore data model proposal and auto code generation
- AI for Prisma data model proposal and GraphQL auto code generation
- Teacher AI trained on Skeet documentation
- TypeDoc auto-generation AI for TypeScript functions
- Translation file generation AI for multilingual support in documentation and apps

Planned future AI support includes:

- AI for auto-generating Firebase Functions code (Development logic support)
- AI proficient in debugging that understands the core of your app code

Skeet aims to boost developer productivity not only by auto-generating foundational code but also by providing robust AI support for application development.

Skeet is developed as an open-source project to reduce development and maintenance costs worldwide and improve developer experience.
