ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) has announced that their development team for the open-source Skeet framework has released a demo featuring Google's Large Language Model (LLM) PaLM2 and Vertex AI.

Skeet is an open-source, serverless framework built with TypeScript, designed for full-stack application development on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Firebase.

With Skeet, you can rapidly develop everything from API servers to Web, iOS, and Android apps using TypeScript. The framework actively incorporates technologies with a good reputation for developer experience, such as GraphQL and Firestore. It also facilitates the development of modern applications using AI technologies like ChatGPT and Vertex AI, as well as blockchain technologies like Solana for Web3 dApp development.

This release allows users to try out an AI chatbot powered by Google's LLM PaLM2 and Vertex AI via the Skeet demo linked below. You can also test ChatGPT's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 from the same demo, enabling you to compare and evaluate which AI is suitable for different use-cases.

## Google's LLM PaLM2 and Vertex AI

PaLM2 is a Large Language Model (LLM) developed by Google and is now available on Google Cloud's Vertex AI. It is also the model that powers Bard, another AI chat service provided by Google.

PaLM2 is trained efficiently using a diverse, multilingual pre-training dataset and performs well even with fewer tokens or smaller models. The model can be fine-tuned by providing example prompts, making it easy to create specialized AI chatbots for various use-cases.
