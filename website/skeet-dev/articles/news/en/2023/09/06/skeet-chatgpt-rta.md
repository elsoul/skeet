ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) is pleased to announce that its CEO, Kawasaki, has set a new world record (according to our research) of 37 minutes and 48 seconds in a Real-Time Attack (RTA) for releasing an AI chat app using ChatGPT on the cloud.

In this RTA, the time taken to develop an AI chatbot app from scratch using the ChatGPT API and release it on the cloud (Google Cloud and Firebase) was measured. The use of the Skeet framework demonstrated that a rapid and reproducible app development environment can be established, thereby enhancing the developer experience.

Anyone can participate in this RTA if they can release a scalable app on the cloud. The use of Skeet is not a requirement; you can challenge this with any method. We look forward to your participation.

Skeet is an open-source, TypeScript-based serverless framework that allows you to build full-stack apps on Google Cloud (GCP) and Firebase.

With Skeet, you can rapidly develop everything from API servers to Web, iOS, and Android apps using TypeScript. It actively incorporates technologies with a good reputation for developer experience, such as GraphQL and Firestore. Skeet is a modern application framework that makes it easy to develop applications utilizing AI like ChatGPT and Vertex AI, as well as blockchain-based Web3 dApps using platforms like Solana.

You can try the demo from the link below. Both PaLM2 and Vertex AI are available for trial, along with OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-3.5, GPT-4), so you can compare their respective features.
