Skeet is an open-source, TypeScript-based serverless framework that enables full-stack app development on Google Cloud and Firebase.

With Skeet, you can rapidly develop everything from API servers to Web, iOS, and Android apps using TypeScript. The framework actively incorporates technologies with good developer experience, such as GraphQL and Firestore. It also simplifies the development of applications using AI technologies like ChatGPT and Vertex AI, as well as blockchain-based Web3 dApps using platforms like Solana.

You can try the demo from the link below. Both PaLM2 and Vertex AI, along with OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-3.5, GPT-4), can be tested simultaneously, allowing you to compare their respective features.
