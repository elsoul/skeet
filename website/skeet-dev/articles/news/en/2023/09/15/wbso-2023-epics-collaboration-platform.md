ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) is pleased to announce that the Epics Collaboration Platform has been selected for the 2023 WBSO (Advanced Scientific Research and Development) project by the Dutch Government. This platform includes both the Epics and Skeet frameworks.

## What is Epics?

Epics is a Web3 game that promotes open-source development. Open-source software is adopted by over 90% of companies and has significant societal value. However, it also faces the critical challenge of resource shortages. Epics tackles this issue by utilizing gamification and token economics to create a sustainable development environment for open-source software.

Skeet is an open-source app development solution capable of AI auto-code development. It allows for rapid development of Web/iOS/Android apps and supports a wide range of developments, including AI-powered chatbot apps, Web3 apps utilizing blockchain, and dApps.

AI is also used in the development flow, overcoming the learning curve that is a challenge in software frameworks. Developers can quickly start building functional apps and publish them in the cloud.

## Synergy Between Both Platforms

The open-source Skeet is adopted for both the platform and blockchain development of Epics. Skeet lowers the global cost of application development and promotes more software innovation. Epics supports future innovation by making open-source software development sustainable.

These efforts have been highly evaluated, and both Epics and Skeet have been recognized as advanced scientific research by the Dutch Government.

Moving forward, ELSOUL LABO remains committed to advancing its efforts in promoting open-source development that shapes the future, establishing a sustainable software development environment, and thereby realizing numerous innovations.
