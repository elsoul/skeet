ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) is pleased to announce that its open-source serverless app development tool, Skeet, now supports the new Web3 and blockchain technology, Solana Compressed NFT (cNFT).

While NFT technology has garnered attention as a digital asset, the blockchain fees for large-scale NFT collections can be prohibitively high. This made it impractical to issue individual game items or global user profiles as NFTs.

## What is Solana Compressed NFT (cNFT)?

Solana Compressed NFT (cNFT) is an NFT managed efficiently using data structures like Merkle Trees to reduce data size while maintaining authenticity. Although the Solana chain is relatively inexpensive by default, the cost to mint a single NFT is 0.012 SOL ($0.24 : 1 SOL = $20), which scales linearly. For a collection of 10,000 NFTs, this would cost $2,400, and for a billion NFTs, it would cost $240 million, making it impractical for large-scale NFT collections.

The newly developed cNFT method allows for the issuance of 10,000 NFTs at approximately $70 (34 times cheaper) and a billion NFTs at approximately $10,000 (24,000 times cheaper).

Skeet has integrated technologies from two leading Solana protocols: Metaplex and Helius.

Metaplex is Solana's NFT protocol that sets token standards. It provides the umi framework for handling NFTs and Solana transactions, as well as the Bubblegum tool for issuing cNFTs.

Helius provides Solana's high-performance RPC and the necessary Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API for using cNFTs.

Skeet leverages these technologies, enabling developers to easily utilize Solana Compressed NFTs (cNFTs).
