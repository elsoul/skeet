ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) is pleased to announce that Skeet, an open-source serverless app development tool, now supports Google's new generative AI model, chat-bison-32k.

With this update, developers using Skeet can now benefit from enhanced AI support, enabling the rapid development of more advanced applications. Additionally, the performance of AI integrated into the apps has significantly improved, allowing for the development of more sophisticated services.

## About the New Model chat-bison-32k

Google Cloud announced the new generative AI model chat-bison-32k on September 19, making it available on Vertex AI.

The new model has increased the maximum token limit from the previous 1024 to 8196. The larger the number of tokens, the more capable the model is of handling longer texts and larger data, enabling more advanced responses.

One of the great features of Google's generative AI is its ability to generate specialized responses in specific fields by being trained on question and answer samples. The increase in token limit allows for learning more specialized detailed information, enabling more advanced responses.

The new model chat-bison-32k is also available in the demo app created using Skeet.
