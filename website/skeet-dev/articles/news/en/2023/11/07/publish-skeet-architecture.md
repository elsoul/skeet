ELSOUL LABO B.V. (ELSOUL LABO, headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) has released the serverless architecture diagram for the open-source app development tool, Skeet.

Skeet represents a new revolution in the open-source development tool market, built with TypeScript, it is a state-of-the-art serverless app development framework. It offers flexibility to address various challenges faced by developers, freeing them from the complexities of infrastructure management.

Skeet - Overall Architecture: https://skeet.dev/en/doc/general/overall-architecture/

■ Product Overview

Skeet allows developers to select and apply the necessary features instantly to their projects. By utilizing Firebase Functions with APIs such as Stripe or Discord, it enables a focus on feature development by omitting frontend development. Furthermore, it supports modern app development comprehensively, from data analysis with BigQuery to developing Web3 apps compatible with blockchain wallets.

■ Advantages for Developers

The Skeet CLI fully supports the construction of cloud architecture, allowing developers to concentrate on application development. Utilizing generative AI (LLM), it offers powerful features such as multi-language support for generating translation files, Prisma schema support, and code file generation tailored to Firebase Functions routing, including document generation.

■ Auto-Scaling and Cost Management

Auto-scaling capabilities automatically handle unpredictable load fluctuations, freeing you from the complexities of infrastructure design, development costs, and resource provisioning. With a pay-as-you-go model, you're only charged for the resources used, making it easier to start projects.

■ CI/CD and Security

Native support for GitHub Actions simplifies the setup of CI/CD environments. Additionally, features for enhancing security, such as load balancer configuration and the use of Cloud Armor, are also included.
