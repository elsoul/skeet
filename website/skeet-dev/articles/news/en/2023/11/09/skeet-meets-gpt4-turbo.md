ELSOUL LABO B.V. (headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) has announced that its open-source serverless app development tool, Skeet, made with TypeScript, now incorporates the preview version of OpenAI's new ChatGPT model "GPT-4 Turbo" (gpt-4-1106-preview), which was released on the 6th.

This latest integration paves a new horizon for serverless app development leveraging AI. With Skeet, it's possible to instantly launch applications equipped with generative AI (LLM), minimizing infrastructure design and development efforts. This allows developers to focus on app development and significantly reduces both development and maintenance costs.

Skeet offers comprehensive support powered by AI. Even junior engineers can start intuitively operating without needing to memorize necessary commands, swiftly assembling the required code for app development. Particularly, the update to GPT-4 Turbo enhances the accuracy of output in specified formats like JSON and XML, thus greatly expanding the application scope of generative AI and opening up new possibilities for developers.

## About the New Model, GPT-4 Turbo

GPT-4 Turbo, developed by OpenAI, is the latest language model that significantly surpasses previous models in performance and cost-effectiveness (one-third of the previous cost). Notably, it exhibits greatly enhanced accuracy in language understanding and generation, enabling swift responses to complex demands. The integration of GPT-4 Turbo into Skeet transforms the use of AI in app development, making it more accessible and powerful. It provides effective solutions to a variety of challenges faced by developers, revolutionizing the approach to AI implementation in app development.

In particular, GPT-4 Turbo can accurately output specific formats such as JSON or XML, enabling developers to build more complex data processing and response systems than ever before. This is expected to greatly enhance the functionality and user experience of applications.

Furthermore, the integration of GPT-4 Turbo into Skeet allows developers to reduce the requirement for expertise in frameworks and other peripheral technologies, thereby cutting development process costs. Equipped with advanced natural language processing capabilities and the ability to retain large contexts, GPT-4 Turbo can analyze user inputs or written source code and instantly generate appropriate responses. This enables a range of support, from suggesting and executing commands to generating code and solving errors.

Unlike previous models, which were based on knowledge up to September 2021, the new model is equipped with the latest knowledge up to April 2023. This allows it to be well-versed in modern serverless development and the latest TypeScript, keeping up with evolving best practices and aiding in writing more comfortable and efficient code.

Fumitake Kawasaki, CEO of ELSOUL LABO, commented, "The integration of GPT-4 Turbo into Skeet is part of our commitment to driving innovation in open-source software. It allows developers to build high-quality applications more rapidly and efficiently."

## Rapid Serverless App Development with Google Cloud and Firebase - Open-Source "Skeet" Framework
