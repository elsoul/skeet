ELSOUL LABO B.V. (headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) announces its technological partnership with Neon (headquartered in San Francisco, in the U.S., CEO: Nikita Shamgunov), a provider of serverless Postgres databases.

While relational databases traditionally struggled with auto-scaling, especially compared to NoSQL databases, this partnership allows for on-demand scaling in Skeet, enabling developers to reduce the burden of infrastructure management and focus more on application functionality development.

Additionally, the future integration of Neon's serverless Postgres database into Skeet Cloud is planned. Skeet Cloud, currently under development, aims to address the scattered nature of serverless app architectures, offering stronger and more manageable monitoring and logging, among other practical development support tools.

## Neon - Serverless Postgres Database

Neon offers a serverless Postgres database solution that achieves on-demand scaling and high cost-efficiency. Key features include:

- **On-demand Scaling:** Separating storage and compute enables on-demand scaling, activating on incoming connections and scaling down to zero when not in use.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Dynamic adjustment of compute resources and integration with cloud object stores like S3 maximizes cost efficiency.
- **Database Branching:** Utilizing "copy-on-write" technology, Neon enables immediate creation of database branches for testing environments and CI/CD pipelines.

## Skeet - TypeScript Serverless Framework

Skeet is a TypeScript-based serverless app development tool, characterized by:

- **Elimination of Infrastructure Design and Management:** Reducing the need for infrastructure preparation and concerns, allowing developers to focus on application logic.
- **Rapid Application Development:** Facilitating fast development cycles, enabling small teams to manage service operations efficiently.

## Innovation through the Skeet and Neon Technological Partnership

This partnership facilitates easy auto-scaling of relational databases, traditionally a challenge, reducing the burden of infrastructure management and allowing developers to focus on application functionality. The integration of Neon's on-demand scaling and high-cost efficiency serverless Postgres solution with Skeet's rapid development environment significantly advances the efficiency of the development process.

## Comments from Neon and Skeet (Development by ELSOUL LABO B.V.)

![Mike Jerome, Product Manager at Neon](/news/2023/12/07/MikeJerome.png)

"The future of application development is serverless, but databases are the last holdouts. Neon is Serverless Postgres. Instant database branching streamlines development workflows and autoscaling stabilizes production environments, helping developers build and scale. We're excited to be part of the serverless ecosystem with our partners." - Mike Jerome, Product Manager at Neon

"We are excited about the technical integration with Neon, which overcomes the limitations of choosing relational databases. Developers can now focus more on application coding, enhancing productivity. Additionally, integrating Neon's serverless database solution into Skeet Cloud allows for more agile and smaller-scale application development, making it easier to meet business requirements. We look forward to future collaborations." - Fumitake Kawasaki, CEO of ELSOUL LABO B.V.
