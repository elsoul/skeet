ELSOUL LABO B.V. (based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and its subsidiary, which supports open-source software development and operates a Web3 NFT card game through Epics DAO, have jointly developed a unique open-source tool for Solana validators, named "solv", to drive innovation and sustainability within the Solana ecosystem. Over the past year, we have extensively operated on the Solana testnet.

Recently, ELSOUL LABO has successfully passed through the rigorous screening process and strict performance standards (which required maintaining server operations in good condition for about a year), completing the onboarding process with the Solana Foundation. As a result, we have officially ascended to become a validator on the Solana mainnet.

ELSOUL LABO is committed to contributing to the stability and security of the Solana blockchain network through this new role. Utilizing our expertise and unique open-source tools, we aim to unlock the full potential of distributed technologies, contributing to the further development of the Solana ecosystem.

ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO believe in the power of open-source and blockchain technologies. Through these innovative technologies, we are dedicated to building a fairer and more transparent digital future.

## About ELSOUL LABO's Ascension to Solana Mainnet Validator

![ELSOUL LABO Solana Mainnet Validator](/news/2024/04/05/ELSOULLABOSolanaMainnetValidator.jpg)

In starting our operations as a Solana mainnet validator, ELSOUL LABO has passed the stringent screening process of the Solana Foundation, following about a year of operation on the testnet, and has been promoted to a mainnet validator.

Our Vote Account for staking is "ELLB9W7ZCwRCV3FzWcCWoyKP6NjZJKArLyGtkqefnHcG". Users with the Phantom wallet or other Solana staking functionalities can find us by searching for "ELSOUL", selecting "ðŸš€ELSOUL LABO B.V.ðŸš€" as their validator. Currently, we are offering a staking reward with an APR of 7.04%.

With your support, ELSOUL LABO will continue to drive further innovation within the Solana ecosystem and contribute to the community at large. We hope you will join us in our vision and growth through staking.

ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO have developed the open-source software "solv" to facilitate easy setup and operation for Solana validators.

With the official start of our operations as a Solana mainnet validator, we will actively address mainnet-specific challenges and improvements, evolving "solv" into an even more convenient tool.

We are honored to continue our active involvement in blockchain technology and open-source software development, contributing to the overall development of the community.

Thank you for your continued support.

## About ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO

The core team of ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO is also actively involved in the development of open-source software.

We have developed two open-source software projects, "solv" and "Skeet", and manage these projects.

![solv](/news/2024/03/12/solvEN.jpg)

"solv" is an open-source tool designed to simplify the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes. To earn rewards as a blockchain validator, it is necessary to prepare a machine with appropriate specifications, install and set up validator software according to documentation, and perform updates several times a week. This series of tasks, which all validators must perform, posed a high barrier to entry due to the specialized knowledge required as a server administrator.

Using solv, anyone can easily set up a Solana validator with just three command copy-pastes. Taking advantage of open-source development, updates can be done by one person globally, and then downloaded by others, completing the process. solv users can finish even daily update tasks with a single command.

"Skeet" is an open-source serverless app development tool using TypeScript, offering modern application framework capabilities such as streamlined infrastructure design and management, rapid application development, flexibility to develop only the needed features quickly, enhanced AI support, and compatibility with dApps and Web3 app development.

The research paper "Skeet: Towards a Lightweight Serverless Framework Supporting Modern AI-Driven App Development" was accepted at the international conference on software engineering, ENASE 2024 (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering), and is scheduled to be presented in France this April.

![Enase 2024 Acceptance Letter](/news/2024/03/12/AcceptanceLetter.jpg)

Following this, the paper is planned to be included and published in the proceedings of ENASE 2024, and will be indexed in multiple leading academic literature search services, including Google Scholar and Scopus.

We will continue to actively engage in open-source software development and support the development environment of open-source projects to foster various innovations.

Thank you for your continued support.
