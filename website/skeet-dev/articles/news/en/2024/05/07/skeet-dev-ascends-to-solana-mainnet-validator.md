ELSOUL LABO B.V. (headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Epics DAO, which manages a Web3 NFT card game to support open-source software development, have been advancing blockchain innovation and sustainable development through the development and operation of the open-source tool "solv" for Solana blockchain validators. After a year of operation on the testnet, "solv" has proven its performance and reliability and is now widely used on both the Solana mainnet and testnet.

The open-source project Skeet, launched by ELSOUL LABO, began its Solana validator journey on the testnet a year ago by utilizing "solv."

Skeet has successfully passed the rigorous onboarding process of the Solana Foundation, maintaining server uptime for about a year and meeting high performance standards. This achievement has elevated Skeet to become a validator on the Solana mainnet.

Over 97% of companies worldwide use open-source software, but development is primarily volunteer-driven. This often delays important tasks like debugging, leaving vulnerabilities in about half of the world's software.

Now, sustainability is crucial for essential open-source projects globally.

Skeet's development team leverages their software development expertise in validator operations, covering necessary costs with earned rewards to tackle this problem and enhance the sustainability of open-source development. This model is expected to help other open-source projects achieve sustainable development.

## About Skeet's Ascension to Solana Mainnet Validator

As Skeet begins operations as a Solana mainnet validator, it has successfully passed the rigorous review process of the Solana Foundation after a year of operation on the testnet. Now, Skeet has been elevated to a Solana mainnet validator.

The Vote Account is "SKTBkag6kjXVTTJb2nWbuK3mZQXnMrrbMPxYU7uhbL7." Those with staking features on Phantom wallets or other Solana validators can search "Skeet" to find "Skeet Framework" and select our validator. We currently offer a staking reward with an APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of 7.05%.

With your support, Skeet will further promote innovation in open-source development and the Solana ecosystem, contributing to the community and society at large. We invite you to join us through staking and become part of our vision and growth.

ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO are co-developing "solv," an open-source software to easily launch and operate Solana validators, and the Skeet development team is also utilizing this software.

With Skeet officially starting as a Solana mainnet validator, ELSOUL LABO now operates a total of three Solana validators. Leveraging this experience, we will actively address challenges and improvements in validator operations, continually evolving "solv" into an even more convenient tool.

We will continue to contribute to blockchain technology and open-source software development, driving innovation for the community.

## ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO

ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO's core teams are actively involved in open-source software development.

They operate two open-source software projects, "solv" and "Skeet."

"solv" is an open-source tool simplifying the setup and operation of Solana validators and RPC nodes. To earn rewards as a blockchain validator, machine resources of proper specifications are needed, and validator software installation and setup should be completed per documentation, followed by several updates each week.

With "solv," Solana validators can be easily launched with just three commands. Updates require only one command, utilizing the open-source nature so that a single person worldwide can manage the update, and others can download it. solv documentation: https://solv.epics.dev/

"Skeet" is an open-source, serverless app development tool using TypeScript, offering a modern application framework for infrastructure management, rapid app development, AI support, and dApp/Web3 development.

The Skeet development team's paper, "Skeet: Towards a Lightweight Serverless Framework Supporting Modern AI-Driven App Development," was presented at ENASE 2024, an international software engineering conference held in Angers, France, on April 28-29, 2024. Dr. James represented the team and received high acclaim for his presentation.
