## About ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering)

![ENASE 2024](/news/2024/03/04/enase2024.jpg)

The mission of ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering) is to become a prime international forum by discussing and publishing the latest research findings and IT industry experiences in software engineering. The conference recognizes the evolution in systems and software thinking due to the contemporary shift of the computing paradigm to e-services, cloud computing, mobile connectivity, business processes, and societal participation.

By publishing research on novel approaches to software engineering and evaluating them against systems and software quality criteria, the ENASE conference advances knowledge and research in software engineering, emphasizing service-oriented, business-process driven, and ubiquitous mobile computing. ENASE aims to identify the most hopeful trends and propose new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in the development, integration, deployment, delivery, maintenance, and evolution of large-scale systems and software.

ENASE 2025 is scheduled to be held in Porto, Portugal next year. We will continue our preparations to present further developments on the Skeet framework at the upcoming conference.
