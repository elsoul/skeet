ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and the Validators DAO, established by the company, have announced that the open-source tool for Solana validators, "solv," is now compatible with the latest Solana Mainnet-Beta v2 update.

With this update, solv users can easily upgrade to v2.0.15 with a simple one-command process. Additionally, by using the auto-update mode, users can automate the update process, freeing them from routine maintenance tasks and further streamlining operations. The auto-update mode for Solana Mainnet-Beta v2 can be turned on or off as needed, enabling flexible management according to operational requirements.

## About Solana Mainnet-Beta v2

On November 8, 2024, the Solana Foundation recommended a swift migration to v2.0.15 for Mainnet-Beta validators, which includes significant performance enhancements. The solv development team responded promptly, ensuring compatibility on the same day.

The v2 update also brings improvements to the validator reward structure. Now, validators receive the full amount of the priority fees paid by users, whereas in v1, only half of the priority fees were allocated as validator rewards. This increase in revenue potential is expected to encourage more validators to join the network, promoting greater decentralization and enhancing security.

By using solv, validators can swiftly migrate to v2.0.15 while benefiting from streamlined update management, helping to support the growth and sustainability of the Solana network as a whole.

For more details, please refer to the solv release notes.
