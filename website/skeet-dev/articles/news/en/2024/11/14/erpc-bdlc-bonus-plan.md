ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Validators DAO operate "ERPC," a global high-speed RPC provider for the Solana network.

BDLC holders can now enjoy the ERPC Developer Plan, typically €42 per month, completely free of charge.

## About the Exclusive Free Offer for BDLC NFT Holders

The Solana blockchain itself is developed as an open-source project, and ERPC similarly operates with the support of numerous open-source software tools.

BDLC NFT holders contribute as sponsors of these open-source tools, and as a token of our appreciation and respect, we have prepared this exclusive free offer. BDLC holders are eligible for the ERPC - Enhanced Solana RPC Developer Plan, which includes 10 million credits per month (normally €42), at no cost.
