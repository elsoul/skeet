## What is a Validator?

A validator is an essential node that verifies the accuracy of data recorded on the blockchain, playing a key role in maintaining network stability and security. By conducting these validation tasks, validators contribute to the network's security and earn incentives in return.

To start as a Solana validator, you can either set up your own node or use an automated management service. If you have technical expertise, you can simplify the setup with an open-source tool called “solv.” For those who prefer an easier approach or require technical support, we recommend using our automated service.

## Why Start Now?

Currently, the Solana Foundation is running the Testnet Incentive and Support Programs (SFDP: Solana Foundation Delegation Program). Through this program, incentives, mainnet voting cost coverage, staking subsidies, and other support are available, making it an ideal time to start a validator operation on the testnet.

Additionally, Solana recently upgraded to v2, which includes an increase in validator block rewards. Previously, in v1, validators received 50% of the priority fees paid by users, but with v2, this percentage has been raised to 100%, enhancing validator revenue.
