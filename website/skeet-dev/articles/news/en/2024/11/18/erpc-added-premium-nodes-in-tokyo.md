ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Validators DAO, operators of the high-speed Solana RPC provider "ERPC," have introduced a new premium-class node in the Tokyo region to meet increasing demand and ensure even better service.

With this addition, users in the Asia region can now enjoy faster and more stable network connections than ever before. Premium-class nodes are designed to maintain high performance even under heavy load, enabling smooth transaction and data request processing.

## Background of Tokyo Region Enhancement

ERPC’s mission is to provide high-speed and reliable RPC services globally for the Solana network. The enhancement of the Tokyo region is a key initiative aimed at achieving the following goals:

- **Improved performance in the Asia region:** Delivering low-latency, stable connections for users in the Asia region, enabling faster transactions and data requests.
- **Ensured scalability:** Effectively distributing network load to accommodate growing user demand and improve service stability.
- **Optimal user experience:** Providing developers and traders with the high-speed and reliable connection environment they need on a global scale.

## Features of the Premium-Class Node

- **1. Low-latency processing with high-performance hardware:** Premium-class nodes are equipped with state-of-the-art high-performance hardware, significantly improving transaction processing speed and minimizing response times for data requests. These nodes excel in high-load environments, consistently delivering stable performance.
- **2. High reliability with redundant architecture:** Designed with redundancy in mind, these nodes automatically switch to backup nodes in the event of network disruptions. This ensures continuous service availability and greatly enhances reliability.
- **3. Custom optimization for maximum performance:** Each request is automatically routed to the most suitable node based on its content, ensuring the highest possible performance. This system efficiently handles large-scale data requests and complex transactions, providing a seamless experience.

Through the enhancement of the Tokyo region, ERPC is committed to delivering greater convenience and a highly reliable network environment for users in the Asia region. Moving forward, we will continue to incorporate user feedback and actively expand services and develop new features across regions.
