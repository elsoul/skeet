ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Validators DAO, operators of the high-speed RPC provider "ERPC" for the Solana blockchain network, have launched gRPC support to further enhance their service based on user feedback.

With the newly introduced gRPC support, developers and users can now access slot, block, transaction, and account update notifications in real-time and at high speed. This upgrade offers an ideal solution for projects requiring fast data access and stable connections on the Solana blockchain network.

## Overview, Features, and Benefits of gRPC Support

ERPC is committed to providing fast and reliable RPC services globally for the Solana blockchain network. The introduction of gRPC support represents a significant effort to enhance real-time data processing capabilities for users.

- **Enhanced Real-Time Data Processing:** By setting up data hooks for slots, blocks, transactions, and account updates on the Solana blockchain network, users can monitor and retrieve critical data in real-time. This ensures that developers and traders can efficiently manage essential information about network changes.
- **Standardized Access Path:** Leveraging gRPC provides an efficient and standardized interface, simplifying the complexity of data retrieval. This enables easier and faster real-time data monitoring.
- **Improved Scalability and Stability:** As user demand grows, gRPC helps distribute network load efficiently, ensuring stable data processing even under high-load conditions. This results in a more reliable real-time environment.
- **Fast and Efficient Real-Time Notifications:** With gRPC, ERPC delivers real-time data notifications faster and more reliably than traditional methods. This allows users to seamlessly track network events and data updates.
