ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki), together with Epics DAO, an organization established by the company to support open-source software development through a Web3 NFT card game, is operating mainnet validators with a complete 0% fee model to enhance the security of the Solana ecosystem and provide users with maximum TrueAPY.

## The Role of Validators and Staking in Solana

Solana is a high-performance blockchain network that adopts a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, where validators play a central role in maintaining its security and reliability. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and generating blocks on the network.

Solana's staking system allows users (stakers) to delegate their SOL tokens to validators to support network operations. This system provides the following benefits and security features:

- **Incentives to Eliminate Malicious Nodes:** Validators earn rewards based on the SOL delegated to them. However, malicious behavior can result in slashing (a penalty that reduces staked assets). This incentive mechanism ensures the security of the network.
- **High Annual Yield for Stakers:** As of November 2024, stakers can earn over 7% annual yield on their delegated SOL. This creates a strong economic motivation for participation in the network.

These mechanisms enable Solana to achieve high performance and security. Additionally, staking decentralization is crucial to maintaining the health of the network.

## Our Initiatives to Strengthen the Solana Ecosystem: Decentralization, Efficiency, and 0% Fee Operation

### Reducing Spam Transactions and Enhancing Efficiency with Jito Client

By adopting the Jito Client, we have reduced spam transactions on the Solana network, prioritizing critical transactions that benefit the chain. This improves trading efficiency for traders and enhances the overall health of the Solana network.

Additionally, by setting Jito MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) fees to 0%, we maximize profitability for traders while improving operational efficiency for the network.

### Providing Maximum Returns with 0% Staking Fees

Our validators are configured with 0% fees for both Jito MEV and staking. This initiative provides the following benefits:

- **Maximum Returns for Users:** Unlike other validators, our 0% fee model ensures that users can maximize their returns on staked SOL.
- **Improved Native Staking Efficiency:** With no fees, our model offers the highest TrueAPY (annual percentage yield) in Solana staking, making it the best option for users.

### Building a Secure Solana Network through Decentralization

Currently, staking concentration among large validators poses a security risk for the Solana network. To address this issue, we are taking the following measures:

- **Promoting Decentralization with 0% Fees:** By adopting a 0% fee model, we make it easier for users to choose our validators, reducing staking concentration and promoting network decentralization.
- **Enhancing Network Security:** Decentralization minimizes the risk of single points of failure and improves the overall resilience and reliability of the network.

### Achieving Maximum Operational Efficiency with High-Performance Infrastructure

To deliver the best performance, we are implementing the following:

- **Utilizing High-Spec Machines:** We deploy cutting-edge hardware to maximize transaction processing and data synchronization performance.
- **Operating in Optimal Locations:** Strategically selected locations ensure low latency, enabling faster transaction and data processing.
- **No Downtime Updates:** Maintenance and updates are performed with no downtime, ensuring a stable service experience.
