ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki), along with Epics DAO and Validators DAO, has launched the operation of a dedicated ShredStream Proxy to enhance the efficiency of Solana blockchain validator operations.

## What is ShredStream?

ShredStream is a service that enables the fastest possible reception of shreds distributed by leaders on the Solana network.

Shreds are fragments of transaction data divided for efficient propagation across the Solana network. This mechanism significantly improves block creation and transaction propagation speeds, providing the foundation for high throughput and low latency.

By deploying a dedicated ShredStream Proxy, validators can receive block data from the network at unparalleled speed, resulting in the following benefits:

- **Achieving lower latency communication:** The dedicated ShredStream Proxy drastically improves block update speeds, offering an edge in scenarios requiring high-frequency voting.
- **Improving validator operational efficiency:** Faster data processing leads to higher voting rates and maximized block rewards.

This technology has already been implemented in the Solana mainnet validators operated by ELSOUL LABO and Epics DAO. After deployment, increases in block rewards and operational efficiency were observed, providing stakers with a stable foundation for higher returns.

You can stake with these high-performance validators free of charge at the following link:

## Integration into the Open-Source Tool solv

To further improve the quality of the Solana network, we are planning to integrate the ShredStream Proxy deployment functionality into the open-source Solana validator tool “solv.” Solv already supports Jito Relayer setup and is designed to enhance the usability for validator operators.

solv aims to improve the overall quality and efficiency of the Solana network and is being developed and released as an open-source project. The integration of this new functionality will contribute to network-wide improvements, and its release is being prioritized.

For more information and updates on solv, please visit:

ELSOUL LABO B.V., Epics DAO, and Validators DAO are committed to improving the quality of the Solana network in collaboration with the community. Stay tuned for further updates.
