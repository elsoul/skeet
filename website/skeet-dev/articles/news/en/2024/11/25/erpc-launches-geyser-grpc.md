ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Validators DAO, operators of the global RPC provider "ERPC," have launched the Geyser gRPC Connection to enhance real-time data access on the Solana network.

This service allows users to stream transaction data from the Solana network in real time. By setting triggers based on transaction or account update information, programs can be automatically activated at precise moments. For example, you can initiate a subsequent trade immediately after a specific trade is completed or automate workflows triggered by account updates, enabling a wide range of use cases.

By leveraging real-time data streams, developers and operators can achieve system-wide responsiveness that surpasses conventional methods such as HTTP APIs or WebSocket connections.
