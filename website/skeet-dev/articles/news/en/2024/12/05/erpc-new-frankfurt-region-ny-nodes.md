ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Validators DAO, which operate the global RPC provider "ERPC," have announced the launch of a new Frankfurt region and the deployment of high-performance nodes in the New York region, effective January 2025.

Currently, ERPC is used by users in over 10 countries, earning high praise for its reliability and high-speed performance. The New York region is the most utilized, valued for its low latency and stable connection quality. Meanwhile, the Frankfurt region has been the most requested by users, and this new addition will further enhance accessibility.

## About the New Frankfurt Region

Solana usage in Europe is particularly concentrated in Amsterdam and Frankfurt, leading to network congestion and increasing demand for low-latency and high-speed RPC services. To meet these needs, ERPC has launched the new Frankfurt region. This expansion will alleviate network congestion and provide reliable connection environments for projects and users across the EU region.

## Upgrades to the New York Region

The New York region is the most heavily utilized region in ERPC's network. With the introduction of new high-performance nodes powered by AMD's fourth-generation CPUs, ERPC is further enhancing its capacity to handle increasing requests while delivering even faster and more stable connections.
