ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, the Netherlands; CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) and Validators DAO, which promotes the decentralization and security enhancement of the Solana network, announce a price revision for the Solana automated validator operation plan.

## Background of the Price Revision

On December 20, 2024, the Solana Foundation announced changes to the testnet requirements, recommending the use of a new client software called "Firedancer." As a result, many validators participating in the Solana Foundation’s Delegation Program are now compelled to upgrade their node specifications. For validator operators relying on the previously minimum recommended specs, limited CPU and memory resources often lead to unstable operations, making it difficult to maintain consistent uptime unless they migrate to higher-spec nodes. Should they fail to run stably, they risk losing both staking rewards and the delegation benefits.

Furthermore, global shortages of high-spec servers and increasing electricity costs have raised the hurdles for procuring powerful computing resources. While validators must frequently update software and maintain robust security measures, operating on nodes with insufficient specs inevitably raises the risk of downtime and performance degradation. However, upgrading to high-spec nodes enables stable performance and helps maximize rewards, while contributing to the overall quality of the Solana chain. In fact, many cases demonstrate that investing in quality rather than cutting costs leads to higher long-term profitability.

This increase in resource requirements reflects the Solana client’s challenge to pursue even faster and more stable blockchain performance, and we are committed to fully supporting these advancements.

## About the New Pricing

In response to these developments, we will implement a new pricing plan starting December 25, 2025. By standardizing high-spec nodes and strengthening the operational environment to more efficiently handle updates and potential issues, we aim to support higher uptime and consistent rewards. Increasing node specifications also allows flexible adaptation to evolving testnet requirements, minimizing downtime and ensuring stable validator operations over the long term.

For mainnet validators as well, choosing high-spec servers can increase the success rate of block production, thereby enhancing overall chain quality and maximizing rewards.

We also plan to establish a global edge data center in the future to reinforce the Solana-focused network. This initiative will enable us to provide high-quality operations at stable prices, further contributing to the overall quality of the network.

## About Validators Solutions

Operating a Solana validator properly can be rewarded accordingly. However, setting up nodes, performing frequent software updates, and handling security measures require specialized knowledge and effort, posing a high barrier to entry for many. Validators Solutions automates these operational tasks, offering an environment that allows even beginners to manage validators reliably. By enabling more participants to earn rewards while contributing to the Solana network, we strive to enhance its decentralization and security.
