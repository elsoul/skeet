title: Setup - Firestore
description: Describes the setup for getting started with the Skeet framework.
---

In this chapter, we will set up a cloud environment for the Skeet framework and
Learn how to call OpenAI APIs from Firebase Functions.

As you set up your domain and obtain an SSL certificate,
Please use a domain that you have already acquired, or acquire a new domain.
It is assumed that you can configure the following items for the domain.

- Name Server

If you don't have permission to configure Name Server,
You will need permission to configure the following items.

- A Record
- CAA Record

Using a load balancer, you will be able to call functions from the following endpoints.

`https://lb.<your-domain>/skeet-fucn/root`

Furthermore, by combining CloudArmor together, you will be able to set security policies for each endpoint.

Production applications require security measures such as DOSS attacks.
Configure server resources and security policies for each endpoint,
Let's manage server resources efficiently.

## 💃 What's Skeet? 🕺

⚡️ Do more, manage less ⚡️

Reduce app development and operation costs and realize more plans.

Skeet is an open-source full-stack app development solution.

You can start writing app logic immediately without worrying about infrastructure.

Here we will explain how to set up a VPN and load balancer using `skeet init`.
It also automatically sets security policies to protect your apps using CloudArmor.

This command creates a Firebase project and a Google Cloud project.

## Upgrade to Firebase Blaze Plan

To unlock the full power of Skeet Framework, you need a Firebase Blaze plan or higher.
Please visit the link provided in the console log to upgrade your plan.

```bash
⚠️ Please update your firebase plan to Blaze to fully utilize the features of Skeet Framework.

To update the plan, visit the following link 👇

https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/skeet420/usage/details

? Did you update your firebase plan to Blaze? Yes
```

![画像](https://storage.googleapis.com/skeet-assets/imgs/backend/firebase-plan-en.png)

From the Firebase console's bottom left menu, select _Upgrade_.

- [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/usage/details)

Once your project is created, you will be asked to confirm that you have upgraded your plan.
If you press y, a browser will open and ask you to authenticate with Firebase, so click on the link to authenticate.

```bash

Once the deployment is complete, you will see the endpoint in the logs,
You will be asked to create a GitHub repository.

To create a GitHub repository, select Yes
Please enter the repository name.

A GitHub repository is created and GitHub Actions are automatically configured.

```bash
? What's your domain address for App fr.figaro.one
? What's your domain address for Domain Name Server figaro.one
? What's your subdomain address for Load Balancer backend.figaro.one
```

Please enter the following items to configure your domain.

- App domain example: app.figaro.one
- DNS domain example: figaro.one
- Load Balancer domain Example: backend.figaro.one

```bash
🚸 === Copy & Paste below nameServer addresses to your DNS Setting === 🚸

ns-cloud-d1.googledomains.com.
ns-cloud-d2.googledomains.com.
ns-cloud-d3.googledomains.com.
ns-cloud-d4.googledomains.com.

👷 === https will be ready in about an hour after your DNS settings === 👷

If you are not utilizing Google DNS, it is necessary to manually configure the A and CAA records.
Please set up the three records listed below:

DNS Records Setup:
--------------------------------
1. A Record:
   Address: x.x.x.x

2. CAA Records:
   - 0 issue "pki.goog"
   - 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"

✔ You are all set 🎉

📗 Doc: https://skeet.dev
```

If the load balancer creation is successful
Displays the name server for configuring DNS settings.
When using Google DNS, go to the management screen of the domain company where you acquired the domain.
Please set the record for the name server shown in the log.

If you don't use Google DNS, set up your A and CAA records manually.

1. A Record:
   Address: Your Load Balancer IP Address

2. CAA Records:
   - 0 issue "pki.goog"
   - 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"

\*It will take approximately 1 hour to complete SSL authentication.

Please check if the domain is set up correctly after 1 hour.

https://<your-domain>/skeet-func/root

```bash
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

If you see the above response, the setup is complete.

### Testing Firebase Functions with Firebase Shell

You can test Firebase Functions in your development environment using the skeet c command.
The following command starts firebase shell.

```bash
$ skeet c
> firebase
```

Let's call the `root` function that is defined by default.

```bash
firebase > root()
firebase > root()
Promise {
  <pending>,
  [Symbol(async_id_symbol)]: 9744,
  [Symbol(trigger_async_id_symbol)]: 4
}
firebase >
RESPONSE RECEIVED FROM FUNCTION: 200, {
  "status": "success"
}
```

If you see the response `{"status": "success"}`, the setup is complete.

## How to setup Secret Key

#### - Create OpenAI API Key

#### - Set Secret Key in Cloud Secret Manager

using the _skeet add secret <secretKey>_ command

Set the OpenAI Organization ID as an environment variable.

```bash
$ skeet add secret
? Enter Secret Key (CHAT_GPT_ORG)
? Enter Secret Value [hidden] <yourOpenAIOrganizationID>
✅ Successfully added secret: CHAT_GPT_ORG in ./skeet-cloud.config.json
✔  Created a new secret version ../secrets/CHAT_GPT_ORG/versions/1
```

Set CHAT_GPT_KEY as well.

```bash
$ skeet add secret
? Enter Secret Key (CHAT_GPT_KEY)
? Enter Secret Value [hidden] <yourOpenAIKey>
✅ Successfully added secret: CHAT_GPT_KEY in ./skeet-cloud.config.json
✔  Created a new secret version ../secrets/CHAT_GPT_KEY/versions/1
```

To check the secret you set, run the following command.

```bash
$ skeet get secret
? Select secret keys (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert
selection, and <enter> to proceed)
❯◯ CHAT_GPT_ORG
 ◯ CHAT_GPT_KEY
```

Enter the space key to select the secret you want to check.

## Use the configured secret with Firebase Functions

Set the Organization ID and API Key in `functions/skeet-func/src/routings/https/root.ts` as shown below.

Additionally, by default, HTTP instances are created in a public network environment;
In the production environment, in order to be able to access from the load balancer in a private network environment,

Change the option used from _publicHttpOption_ to _privateHttpOption_.

```typescript
import { onRequest } from 'firebase-functions/v2/https'
import { privateHttpOption } from '@/routings/options'
import { TypedRequestBody } from '@common/types/http'
import { RootParams } from '@common/types/http/rootParams'
import { defineSecret } from 'firebase-functions/params'
import {
  ChatCompletionMessageParam,
  defaultOpenAIConfig,
  openAIChat,
} from '@skeet-framework/ai'

const CHAT_GPT_ORG = defineSecret('CHAT_GPT_ORG')
const CHAT_GPT_KEY = defineSecret('CHAT_GPT_KEY')

export const root = onRequest(
  { ...privateHttpOption, secrets: ['CHAT_GPT_ORG', 'CHAT_GPT_KEY'] },
  async (req: TypedRequestBody<RootParams>, res) => {
    try {
      const context =
        'You are an assistant to cheer up people.You reply with the maximum of positive words.'
      const contents: ChatCompletionMessageParam[] = [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: context,
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content:
            'Hiiiiiiii, there! How are you doing today?\nLFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG🚀',
        },
        {
          role: 'assistant',
          content: 'I am doing great!LFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG🚀\nHow are you?',
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: "What's up?",
        },
      ]
      let config = defaultOpenAIConfig
      config.organizationKey = CHAT_GPT_ORG.value()
      config.apiKey = CHAT_GPT_KEY.value()
      config.stream = false
      const result = await openAIChat(contents, config)
      res.json({ status: 'success', result })
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ status: 'error', message: String(error) })
    }
  }
)
```

Call the root function in the skeet console to check if the Organization ID and API Key are set correctly.

```bash
$ skeet console
firebase > root()
RESPONSE RECEIVED FROM FUNCTION: 200, {
  "status": "success",
  "result": "Hello, Earthling! (Or whatever planet you hail from!) What's up today? Any exciting news or updates you'd like to share? I'm all ears, ready to be dazzled by your awesomeness! Let's make today spectacular! 💫"
}
```

Success! The setup is complete.
