The staked SOL is then distributed among high-quality validators through the elSOL stake pool, designed to achieve optimal yields. The rewards earned by these validators are added back into the pool, increasing the value of elSOL over time. This is why 1 SOL is not equal to 1 elSOL. By holding elSOL, you continue to accumulate rewards and can benefit more the longer you hold.",

As an LST, elSOL allows you to freely swap it for other tokens without locking them, unlike traditional staking.

This allows you to earn staking rewards while also leveraging the DeFi ecosystem to maximize your assets' efficiency.",
